# Amethyst
Amethyst is an implementation of [Lazurite programming language](https://github.com/ArtyomKingmang/Lazurite), 
written in Java, that compiles code written in Lazurite to [Moonflower VM](https://github.com/quantumatic/moonflower-vm) bytecode.

Amethyst has a concrete set a goals to achieve in the future:
* to have acceptable compilation times, even on large projects.
* to achieve incremental compilation (cache previous compilation results).
* to run code analyses in parallel.
